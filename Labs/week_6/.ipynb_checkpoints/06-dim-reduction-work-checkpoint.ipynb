    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let the data be the set of data points $\\{\\mathbf{x}_n\\}_{n=1}^N$, $\\mathbf{x}_n\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$, with mean $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N\\mathbf{x}_n$ and covariance matrix $\\mathbf{S}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N(\\mathbf{x}_n-\\bar{\\mathbf{x}})(\\mathbf{x}_n-\\bar{\\mathbf{x}})^T.$\n",
    "\n",
    "From lectures, we derived that if we are linearly projecting onto a subspace $m<d$, then the $m$ directions to linearly project on are given by the $m$ eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{S}$ whose eigenvalues are the $m$ largest, and the variance along each direction is equal to that eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the SVD to implement PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}=\\mathbf{0}$. Then $\\mathbf{S}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N\\mathbf{x}_n\\mathbf{x}_n^T$. \n",
    "However, it turns out that\n",
    "$$\\sum_{n=1}^N\\mathbf{x}_n\\mathbf{x}_n^T=X^TX$$\n",
    "where $X\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times d}$ is the data matrix.\n",
    "Thus to find the eigenvalues and vectors of the covariance matrix, we need to find the eigenvalues and vectors of $\\frac{1}{N}X^TX$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that if the SVD of $X$ is $X=U\\Sigma V^T$, then the eigenvectors of $\\mathbf{S}$ that correspond to its $k$ largest eigenvalues are the column vectors of $V$ that correspond to the $k$ largest singular values of $X$. **Sorry this was wrong in the previous version, where it had $U$ instead of $V$**.\n",
